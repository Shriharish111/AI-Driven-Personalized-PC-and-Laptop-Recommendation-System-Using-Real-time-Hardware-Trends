The PC case houses and protects all internal components while supporting airflow, cooling, and physical compatibility.

A well-designed case helps maintain optimal component temperatures, reduces thermal throttling, and improves overall system stability.

Airflow is a critical factor in case selection. Cases with good ventilation and multiple fan mounting options allow better heat dissipation for CPUs and GPUs.

Poor airflow can cause higher temperatures, reduced performance, and shortened component lifespan, especially in gaming and high-performance systems.

Compact cases are suitable for space-saving builds but may limit cooling options, GPU size compatibility, and future upgrades.

Mid-sized cases provide a balance between size, airflow, and component compatibility, making them suitable for most gaming and productivity systems.

Larger cases offer better airflow, easier cable management, and support for high-end components, but require more physical space.

Case compatibility depends on motherboard form factor, GPU length, CPU cooler height, and power supply size.

Proper cable management improves airflow, simplifies maintenance, and enhances system aesthetics.

Support for additional cooling options such as multiple fans or liquid cooling radiators is important for performance-focused builds.

Choosing an appropriate case ensures good thermal performance, ease of assembly, component protection, and long-term upgrade flexibility.
