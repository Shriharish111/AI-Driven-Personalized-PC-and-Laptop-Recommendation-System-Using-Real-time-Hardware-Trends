The motherboard is the central circuit board that connects and coordinates all system components including the CPU, RAM, storage, GPU, and power supply.

Motherboards determine system compatibility, expansion capability, power delivery quality, and overall system stability.

CPU compatibility depends on the motherboard socket type and chipset. A motherboard must support the specific CPU generation and socket to function correctly.

Entry-level motherboards provide essential functionality and are suitable for basic systems without overclocking, heavy expansion, or advanced connectivity requirements.

Mid-range motherboards offer improved power delivery, better thermal design, additional connectivity options, and support for faster memory speeds. They are ideal for gaming and productivity systems.

High-end motherboards are designed for enthusiasts and professional users who require advanced features such as overclocking support, high-speed storage interfaces, premium audio, and extensive expansion options.

Memory support depends on the motherboard’s supported RAM generation, maximum capacity, speed ratings, and memory channel configuration.

Expansion slots allow users to add graphics cards, network cards, capture cards, and other peripherals. The number and type of slots affect future upgrade potential.

Storage support varies by motherboard and includes interfaces for SATA drives and high-speed solid-state storage. The number of supported storage devices impacts system expandability.

Power delivery components on the motherboard influence system stability, especially when using high-performance CPUs and GPUs.

Form factor determines the physical size of the motherboard and affects case compatibility. Common form factors include compact and standard-sized boards.

Selecting the appropriate motherboard ensures reliable system operation, component compatibility, and flexibility for future upgrades.
