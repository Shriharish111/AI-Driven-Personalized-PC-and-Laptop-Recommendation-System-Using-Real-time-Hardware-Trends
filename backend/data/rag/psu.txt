The PSU (Power Supply Unit) provides electrical power to all components in the system and plays a critical role in system stability, safety, and longevity.

A reliable PSU ensures consistent voltage delivery to the CPU, GPU, motherboard, storage, and other components, preventing crashes and hardware damage.

Low-quality or insufficient power supplies can cause system instability, unexpected shutdowns, component failure, and reduced hardware lifespan.

PSU wattage determines how much total power can be delivered to the system. Gaming and high-performance systems require higher wattage to support powerful CPUs and GPUs.

Choosing a PSU with additional wattage headroom allows for stable operation, peak load handling, and future component upgrades.

PSU efficiency ratings indicate how effectively electrical power is converted and delivered. Higher efficiency reduces wasted energy, heat generation, and power consumption.

Modular and semi-modular power supplies allow users to connect only the required cables, improving airflow and cable management inside the case.

Non-modular power supplies include all cables permanently attached and are generally more affordable but less flexible for clean builds.

Power supply connectors must match the requirements of system components, including motherboard power, CPU power, and GPU power connectors.

Modern GPUs often require dedicated high-power connectors, making PSU compatibility an important consideration for gaming and AI workloads.

PSU form factor affects physical compatibility with the case. Most standard systems use common PSU form factors, but compact cases may require smaller units.

Selecting a high-quality PSU ensures system reliability, protects components from electrical issues, and supports long-term performance and upgradeability.
